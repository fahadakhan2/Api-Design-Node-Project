# Api-Design-Node-Project

In this project, I built a robust API replicating a product update log system for a website (https://www.framer.com/templates/chronos/). Starting with Express.js, I designed a well-structured REST API for seamless interactions. To manage data, I integrated Prisma, providing an intuitive way to interact with a hosted PostgreSQL database. I also implemented JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure user authentication. I also made this API deployment-ready so it can be shared and utilized in a production environment. Finally I deployed it to the web using render.com as a deployment service.
